                <h5 class="brand-title">MY STORY</h5>
                <p class="flex-item-text text-left">
                    I love making videos. My expertise is in creating informative and educational content which provides objective, concise and simplified explanations of complex issues on a variety of subjects.
                    <br><br>
                    I strongly believe in speaking truth to power and practice promoting progressive values of democracy, freedom, rationalism and critical thinking through my videos.
                    <br><br>
                    My background is from mechanical and renewable energy engineering since I did my masters college degree in that. But my passion lies in the fields of Economics and Political Science in which I studied for a second bachelors degree. And yes, I also really really love travelling.

                <h5 class="brand-title">CONTENT & PROMOTIONS</h5>
                <p class="flex-item-text text-left">
                    All my content is suitable for family viewing (free from abusive language or adult jokes)
                    <br><br>
                    Regarding brand promotions, fair business practices followed in all business interactions, including some industry firsts such as: No competition promotions till a fair gap
                    <br><br>
                    Preference is given to products creating a positive impact on humanity and the planet.
                    <br><br>
                    No promotion for products and services which can have  significantly adverse impact on human health, ecology or social well being in society such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling etc.
                    <br><br>
                    There is no price list for the paid promotions, please do not ask for it.
                    <br><br>
                    If you do not want to disclose the brand & product, please do not email me for promotions. I need to ensure that the brand fulfils my promotion criteria.
                    <br><br>
                    I do not provide paid promotions to political parties

                <h5 class="brand-title">CONTACT ME</h5>
                <p class="flex-item-text text-left">
                    Keep your messages precise and short. Emails with large attachments, links with trackers, links that require registration, inappropriate text etc. are set for automated deletion.
                    <br><br>
                    A lot of people write to me about their personal problems or complaints. Please realise that I cannot respond and provide help for every personal problem, I suggest reaching out to a therapist for that. For complaints, report them to suitable authorities.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, I have limited resources and will not be able to reply to all emails. If there is a potential topic for the video, I do keep them in mind for a future video.
